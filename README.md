# ðŸŽ‰ Tic Tac Toe: Exploring React.js! ðŸŽ®
Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ As part of my journey to learn React.js, Iâ€™ve created a simple **Tic Tac Toe** game by following a fantastic tutorial on YouTube. You can check out the tutorial [**React.JS by Web Programming UNPAS**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ji8lAuohopk&list=PLFIM0718LjIUu3X2zYNqomEWs3sYd-fV1&index=3).

This project has been a great opportunity to practice and reinforce my skills. My next step is to follow the official **React Dev Tic Tac Toe** tutorial to gain a deeper understanding of React.js concepts and compare the differences between the two approaches.

Iâ€™m excited to learn, grow, and share my progress as I continue to build projects and experiment with new ideas. Stay tuned for updates! ðŸš€

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
